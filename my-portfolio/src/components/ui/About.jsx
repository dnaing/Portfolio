                            Hello, My name is Derek Naing and my love for technology started as a kid.
                            Whether it be playing games on the Playstation 2 or just messing around on those old,
                            janky computers back then, I was fascinated with it all. In high school, that curiosity deepened.
                            I learned how computers worked under the hood and eventually built my own PC from the ground up.
                            Around that time, I also got involved in robotics and joined my school's team, where
                            I had the opportunity to compete in several VEX Robotics and Botball competitions,
                            contributing both as a builder and a coder. This hands-on experience inspired me to pursue computer science, and I went on
                            to study it as my major at the University of California - Irvine. Eventually, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science
                            and was ready to step into the next chapter of my journey.

                        <p>
                        There are so many exciting pathways in the world of software, and I wanted to explore them all.
                        For a while, I was captivated by artificial intelligence. Later, I got into game development and created a
                        few small projects using the Unity engine. Eventually, I found myself drawn to web development.
                        The idea that you could build something helpful or entertaining — something anyone with an internet connection
                        could access — really resonated with me. I started by learning the fundamentals: classic JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
                        From there, I dove deeper into the stack, focusing on React for the frontend, Node.js or Python Flask for the backend,
                        and SQL or MongoDB for the database. More recently, I discovered 3D rendering on the web through a library called
                        Three.js. It instantly reminded me of my time with Unity, and I was fascinated by the fusion of 3D graphics and web technology.
                        Following along with Bruno Simon's "Three.js Journey" opened up a whole new world of creative possibilities. Now,
                        I'm excited to keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible on the web — and to bring playful,
                        immersive experiences to every project I build.

                        <p>
                            Outside of coding and software, I have a wide range of interests that keep me inspired and balanced. I'm an avid gamer,
                            with a love for roguelike titles, as well as the soulsborne series. This passion extends into board games and tabletop RPGs
                            like Dungeons and Dragons. I also enjoy diving into anime and manga - Hunter X Hunter is my current favorite. In my downtime,
                            I find myself drawn to horror and uncanny videos. To stay active, I like to train martial arts, having been influenced by
                            action movies as a kid. I've practiced a little bit of taekwondo in the past, and I'm currently focused on Muay Thai.
                            Lately, I've also been exploring cardistry, and you've probably noticed that woven throughout this portfolio as well.
